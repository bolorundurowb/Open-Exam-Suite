Please join the discussion abotu the future of this project [here](https://github.com/bolorundurowb/Open-Exam-Suite/issues/85)

__The former aim to convert existing `VCE` exams to the `OEF` format has been dropped. If you want any feature in the next release, create an [issue](https://github.com/bolorundurowb/Open-Exam-Suite/issues) here on Github or hit me up on twitter [@Mr_Bolorunduro](https://twitter.com/Mr_Bolorunduro).__ **If this project has been of benefit to you, feel free to give it a star so others can find it too.**

This project is an answer to a call to develop an open source alternative to Avanset's Visual CertExam Suite. This project has an exam designer that creates an *oef* (Open Exam Format) file and an exam simulator that can read and simulate the exam. It aims to be the open source solace for those wanting to take computer based simulated examinations.
Answering the call to design an open source alternative to Avanset's Visual CertExam Suite birthed version one of open exam suite and as I was still learning and getting a hang of the language, the code written is less than ideal which gave birth to version two of the software which based on the new knowledge was better written and had new features. The code resides [here](https://github.com/bolorundurowb/Open-Exam-Suite/tree/version2).

[NB: the version 1 and 2 *oef* files are basically just zip files that contain an XML file and images. The XML contains the exam details and structure while the pictures are question images]

***Please, I am working on a site where exams that have been compiles using this tool can be shared with the community. Until I'm done, please send them to ogatimo@gmail.com and I'll post them on the product documentation/help page.*** *[http://bolorundurowb.github.io/Open-Exam-Suite](http://bolorundurowb.github.io/Open-Exam-Suite)*
